# Welcome!

I am Zelun Pan, a Ph.D. student in the School of Integrated Circuits, Peking University. I'm fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yuchao Yang](http://yuchaolab.cn/index.html) and [Prof. Yaoyu Tao](https://taoyaoyu.github.io/). I received B.S in EECS, Peking University, in 2024 as an outstanding graduate.

My research interests focus on 

- Heterogeneous Archieture, including memory-centric architectures, optical-electrical computing accelerators and etc. 

- In-Memory-Computing (IMC) chip design.
